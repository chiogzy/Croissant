      <p class="summary-about-croissant">
        Croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry of a cresent shape,
        it is inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French
        yeast-leavened laminated dough.Croissants are named for their historical
        crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
        several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a
        technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
        texture, similar to a puff pastry.
